# Netplay

Host or join a network gaming session. Rediscover the joy of multiplayer games using RetroArch's builtin netplay lobby. You can also use the spectator mode to watch others play. Click the Lobby Browser button now to view Netplay Hosts! Don't forget to check out our Netplay document page!

## Netplay

RetroArch enables you to play games online. You can challenge players around the world and compete on classic games like Mario Kart, Bomberman, Street Fighter, or team up on games like Streets of Rage or Sonic 3.

RetroArch relies on peer-to-peer networking to reduce network latency and ensure the best possible experience.

## The Lobby

The most convenient way to try netplay is to use the lobby inside the menu.

You need an active internet connection and a router that supports UPnP port forwarding.

You will also need to own the same ROM as your partner and have it scanned and in your playlists. We recommend ROMs from the No-Intro sets.

To join a netplay room in the lobby, just refresh the room list and press A on a room entry.

To host your own netplay session, press A on Start netplay host and a room will be created and announced publicly.

This lobby will also work for local rooms (on your home local network).

## Manual Netplay

Advanced users have the possibility to setup netplay manually.

The Network Settings enables you to tweak how the network code will behave when you are acting as Server.

If you don't need NAT traversal, it can be disabled in the settings.

When you are acting as client, most of these settings will have no effect. The only things you will have to set will be the Server IP.

After you have configured netplay as you wish, launch a game and use:

Start netplay host to act as server
Connect to netplay host to act as client
